Start off with typing what your current available budget is.

The program will ask you what the item name is, the weight, and the price of the item.
When you feel you have finished typing in all your products
You can simply type "xxx" as the name to stop.

Example inputs for weight consist of
"250ml" "3L" "200g" "0.5kg"

You will be given a recommendation that fits in your budget with the best value.
You will be prompted if you would like to save your results in the end.
If you do not type in a name, your file name will be the day you got your results.
